# EventDriven
This is a repository for EventDriven, a skeleton for an event selling website.

EventDriven is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework as a student project in [Reykjavik University](https://www.ru.is/)
## Base requirements
The base requrements for the website are as follows:
* Authentication
* Layout site
* Edit profile
* Event detail site
* Book an event
* Finalize booking

## Extra requirements
* Multiple shows for each event
* Multiple zones for each show
    * This way each event can be in multiple venues, each having multiple zones.
* Dynamic tracking of available tickets
    * Each time the event detail site is loaded, the available tickets are checked. 
* Users can see their own tickets on their profile page
